## Reasearch Question:
**Is increase in life expectancy associated with higher economic growth?**

The week 2 blackboard discussion triggered my interest in the relationships between economy and life expectancy, as I have mentioned on the discussion board, I believe the strength of a countryâ€™s economy is the proxy measure of life expectancy. In this project, I would like to do an analysis to find out my previous thought of the proxy measure is correct or not.
